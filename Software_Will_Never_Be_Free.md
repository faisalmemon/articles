# Software Will Never Be Free
> Faisal Memon 13th February 2025.

This article is about the monetary cost of software, as opposed to the freedoms users might have in using a given piece of software.

## History

In the earliest form of software, it was tremendously expensive. You had to build your own hardware for the specific purpose at hand. Think of the early days of the code breakers and the custom deciphering machines that were created from armies of engineers and machine makers.

Of course multiple iterations came along. Firstly, actual programmability allowed tailored software to be deployed without re-wiring the hardware. Then came along compilers, high level programming languages, libraries, Object Oriented paradigms, functional programming, IDEs, etc.

So software became cheaper per unit of functionality.

## Trends

Now the trend is AI-assisted coding (auto-complete on steroids). The next frontier step is Agentic AI (where the prompting process itself is automated; you just specify higher level goals).

**But where is the limit?**

It comes down to the cost per token. If the human contribution diminishes over time, replaced by AI contribution, then AI brings its own underlying cost; the token generation cost.

There is an old joke. A mathematician is just a device that converts coffee into theorems.

So an AI system just converts energy into information (here it is the software we desire).

## Economics

Those countries with the lowest cost source of energy logically then become the most effective producers of software. China currently leads in 4th generation nuclear, with their Pebble Bed Reactor design. This is remarkable technology. It cannot have a core meltdown and cannot be used for weapons proliferation. By 2030 they'll have a massive cost advantage against their rival, the USA.

I am assuming a level playing field in the other dimensions: hardware design, algorithms, and data supply.

But there is another limit, called computational irreducibility. There is no short cut to discovering certain ideas or calculating certain quantities (In computer science theory these are equivalent because programs are numbers, and numbers are programs).

So let's say software becomes mostly free, or at least very abundant because as anyone with a fully loaded iPod of the past knows - it is not just the new tunes, it's the old classics as well. Software is cumulative in its production.

### Markets

**Who will buy if the product is cheap?**

Going all the way back to the start of agriculture, there has always been capital-owning, and salary-earning people. There has developed a hierarchy of income. So there are buyers. Fancy a job as a party planner? Those jobs exist, and if you can access an affluent area maybe you can become one.

The cheaper the product, the larger the market you can address.

Now consider the plight of the digital artist. Digital tools, think of Adobe Illustrator, created that job. If such a tool could be done much better at lower cost, you'd be able to market it to both amateurs and pros alike.

## Price failure

**But where does it all break down?**

**If salary earning people are absent, who will buy software?**

There is a potential catastrophe waiting in the wings. Making cheaper software drives consumption only whilst the hierarchy of incomes across a population is present. But go to an impoverished mining town, and sell your ERP software - see how you fare.

## Society

Not far from where I am sitting is a monkey colony. Two tribes of monkeys live there peacefully. All the fruit and nuts they need are plentiful. It makes for a happy day trip to visit them. The monkeys don't have money, as everything is provided. One can't help wonder, would humans fit into that world of idle enjoyment, or are we built differently?

So certain fundamentals stop software being driven to zero cost. But there is a barrier before that is reached - a societal barrier where the cost of software affects human welfare and macro economic stability. At what price point does the hierarchy of income break down? Cheap software that no-one can afford! Do we need a token-tax? Do we restrict hardware architectures from dissemination? Do we guard the data sets? Do we tax or constrain the electrical power?

## Remedies

A recent analogue to the token tax is the tax that India places on robots. They are at a phase in their economic development that manufacturing is a realistic win (over other low cost regions) if they can only side step the jump straight to robotics (so they can have a skilled workforce employed in manufacturing).

Restricting hardware architectures is a ploy in recent times also. But with necessity being the mother of invention, we see innovations such as DeepSeek (multiple optimizations around interconnect speed and training methodology).

Restricting data as a strategy only works if the law can enforce it. Note the past struggles of the music industry over file sharing. The industry moved to a streaming model as a consequence. Profits still but meagre compared to the past.

## Conclusion

We began by looking at the cost of software, ignoring software freedoms. Now let's turn that around and look in the mirror: Is the price of free software the price of our freedom?
