## Introduction

I see a lot of heated debates on the purpose, allocation, and fairness of the taxation system.  I've been thinking about this at depth and I'd like to share my diagnosis of the problem, visit historical trends, and offer a solution going forwards - foreign exchange equity swaps for VC/PE ownership.  It sounds magical but I will in due course explain.

## Hollowed out tax base

The demographic that pays the most taxation is the "middle class".  This comes from practical realities.  The "working class" can only be taxed to a lower extent due to the limited funds they have in the first place.  They face heavy burdens in the so-called "sin taxes" (cigarettes, alcohol, etc.) and that is the moral justification that allows them to be collected.  The "elites" are not taxed heavily due to the nature of their wealth, mobility of funds, and political and legal affordances they have access to.

But we see a clear trend.  As society leverages technology (software, AI, etc.) more, the rewards to success flow back to the capital owners more than the workers.  Middle class workers are substituted out in favour of technologies that leverage the existing workforce.  The investment return on education has fallen dramatically since the 1990s due to student debt financing and weakened real wages for skilled white-collar jobs, and fewer vacancies for the population of graduates.

## Wealth and Propery Tax

Local governments levy local taxes based on the value of the home you are resident at (ignoring special cases).  This is advertised as a "service fee" to fund the surrounding schools, roads, and civic services.  That is mostly true, but it hides a second component.  The central government provides grants to local government to help pay for services.  If the central government has other priorities (such as a space programme) it can reduce the local government grant.  The money shortfall would come in the form of raise local taxes (as local government only have small other income streams).  This means property tax is partly a service tax, and partly a wealth tax.

The take away point here is that citizens, and particularly the middle class, are paying a wealth tax today.

Now the next evolution of this concept is whether and to what extent can the elites be presented with a wealth tax.

The main counter arguments are the genius argument.  If they are taxed, they'd leave for Dubai, and the economic engine behind their innovations and ideas would damage the local economy and future wealth generators would not setup business in the first place.

Another argument is that private wealth already has come net of capital gains tax, so taxing again is double-dipping (double taxation).

Another argument is liquidity.  If you have a start-up you might own a potentially valuable asset but don't have the cash funds to pay taxes on it.  And the valuation of the asset would be uncertain.  It could even go up and down wildly.  And who trusts the government to competently value private assets anyway?

## Lessons of history

One startling thing from history is the Big Cycle.  The Big Cycle is the observation that inherently when you borrow to grow, that borrowing has to be repaid.  So in terms of dynamics you get a natural debt cycle purely based on that concept.  We know this as the short term boom and recession cycle that happens every 7 years in capitalist economies.  But there is a bigger cycle, 70-80 years, where a massive government level cycle occurs.  This is the cycle of revolution/war/pandemic/plague/inflation into a re-built economy and human psyche, which has a long running boom until the system fails leading to revolution/war/pandemic.  The trigger is usually related to a de-leveraging.  That is where a stone cold reality that public debts cannot be repaid hits.

Who loses the most during such crashes?  Actually it is the elites.  They can loose 100% of their wealth, and oftentimes they have lost their heads.  Physical violence and unimaginable turbulence.

It has happened with regularity, and many times in many places.

It is rare, but possible to avoid the catastrophe.  The so-called beautiful deleverage that FDR did in the USA with the "New Deal".  Basically taxing to incredible levels the elites to fund social programmes, that kept the lid on things and allowed their grandchilden to still be billionaires down the road rather than getting wiped out.

## The Venture Capital / Private Equity route

It would make sense to sacrifice 2% of your wealth each year as an insurance against losing 100% during the Big Cycle.

What I propose is that the government intervene in the PE/VC space.  When a fund invests in a company, the government gets a share.  The government own an asset instead charging a taxation fee.  But the government does it in a monetised way.  What they do is instead of owning 5% of the company when private money invests in a firm, they give the 5% to a foreign entity, such as a sovereign wealth fund or private market investor.  In return, that foreign company pay the government in local currency.  Essentially a yearly cash fee.

The reason for this indirection is that it takes the government out of the pricing game and administrative control of the company.  The point of foreign ownership is that many foreign countries can be used.  This avoids the moral hazard of the government being captured by private interests.  All companies have externalities and the government must hold private activities to account for reasons of the environment, public safety, etc.

This approach, the foreign exchange equity swap, can actually give a side benefit of bring nations together in a common goal of share properity rather than zero-sum games of conquest.

Some people believe in football, some people believe in their religion not your religion; we all have many different beliefs.  But we all believe in money - the most successful mediator between people thus far in history.  We can solve our shared interests with a thoughtful review of how we are taxed. Otherwise revolution calls.
