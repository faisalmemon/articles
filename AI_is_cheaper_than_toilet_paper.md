# AI is Cheaper Than Toilet Paper?

A lot of discussion has been made about token costs when using AI. There is a significant focus by foundation model companies on driving down the cost of AI tokens while increasing the speed and power of such AI systems.

My question is: In practical terms, how cheap is AI?

Many years ago, I was struck by an analysis of Herman Miller chairs. Known for their quality and reliability, and also for their cost! Over a 10-year period, Herman Miller chairs turn out to be cheaper than toilet rolls over the same period, indicating they are an essential and worthwhile investment in ergonomics.

How about the cost of AI tokens?

In a recent coding session, over 4 hours, on a GPT-4.1 nano model, I used about 1.5 million tokens. I assume a typical software engineer will code for about 6 hours per day, accounting for admin and meeting overheads.

Now, at risk of getting too scatalogical, let's say you consume 10 sheets of toilet paper over the day. Your mileage may vary, but let's do a back-of-the-envelope analysis.

- 4 hours of token usage = 1.51 million input tokens, 166,000 output tokens; total cost = $0.14 USD
- 1 hour of work = $0.035 USD
- 6 hours of work = $0.21 USD

AI cost in GBP = GBP 0.1596 (using a 0.76 exchange rate)

Toilet paper, Luxury Soft White, costs GBP 0.16 per 100 sheets.

- 10 sheets = GBP 0.016

So, actually, AI is about 10 times the price of toilet paper.

Just to be provocative, I’ve picked the most trivial cost to compare with AI. I’ve done this because it provides a qualitative sense of where we are at the moment. Most of your costs, either directly borne by you as an independent developer, or indirectly borne by your employer, target much higher expenses in reality.

Given that AI can bring speed, quality, new insights, and greater agility, the question should be: can you afford NOT to use AI?
