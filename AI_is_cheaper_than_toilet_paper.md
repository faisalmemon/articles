# AI is cheaper than toilet paper?

A lot of discussion has been made about token costs when using AI.  There is a massive focus by Foundation Model companies on driving down the cost of AI tokens whilst increasing the speed and power of such AI systems.

My question is: In practical terms, how cheap is AI?

Many years ago I was struck by an analysis of Herman Miller chairs.  Known for their quality and reliability, and also known for their cost!  Over a 10 year period, Herman Miller chairs turn out cheaper than toilet rolls over the same period indicating it as an essential and worthwhile investment in ergonomics.

How about the cost of AI tokens?

In a coding session recently, over 4 hours, on a GPT 4.1 nano model, I used about 1.5M tokens.
I assume a typical software engineer will do 6 hours coding per day, due to admin and meeting overheads.

Now at risk of getting too scatalogical, lets say you consume 10 sheets of toilet paper over the day.  You mileage may vary.  But let us do a back of the envelope analysis.

4 hours of tokens = 1.51M input tokens, 166k output tokens; total cost 0.14 USD
1 hour spend = 0.035 USD
6 hour spend = 0.21 USD

AI Cost in GBP = 0.1596 GBP (0.76 conversion)

Toilet paper, Luxury Soft White, 0.16 GBP / 100 sheets

10 sheets = 0.016 GBP

So actually AI is 10 times the price of toilet paper.

Just to be provacative, I've picked the most trivial cost to compete with the cost of AI.  I've done so because  it gives a qualative feel for where we are at at the moment.  Most of your costs, either directly bourne by you as an independent developer, or indirectly bourne by your employeer, target far higher costs items in reality.

Given that AI can bring speed, quality, new insights, and greater agility, the question should be: can you afford to NOT use AI?
