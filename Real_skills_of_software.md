# The real skills of software development

We live in exciting times.  We live in a time of great change.  What does it mean to be a software engineer?  What skills are needed?

I've generally refrained from airing my opinion on such subjects.  It's because I never really felt qualified enough.  There is so much to software engineering.

But now I feel the need to stick my neck out and provide my opinion.

I've seen quite an era of software engineering.  I started off when I was 13 on home computers and have been programming since, now for 40 years.

The things that have helped me the most are what I believe to be the core skills of software engineering.  There isn't one route to enlightenment but instead many strands of knowledge that coalesce and combine.

## Hackers and Painters influence

Taking a framing from Paul Graham, I think the core of it is having an idea and being willing to just keep chipping away at things.  Being at rest with the idea that you are on a journey, you have ideas, but how things go and what you learn along the way must shape the product as much as your initial conception.
I remember vividly when I was an undergradate Mathematician and we had a computer lab to implement some kind of optimisation algorithm or other.  I found the otherwise top students came to the lab with carefully constructed plans to try out - reading ahead and planning.  I was of the mind you just flicked through the text book, tried out a bit of your code, and then just built on that.
It takes me further back to when I first wrote code.  I would type in it, and be literally shocked that my well crafted mental construction was full of mistakes!  I thought that was back luck or a lack of talent.  I was frustrated.  I secretly became really good at debugging to cover up for my failings.
Over time, I just embraced the harsh reality that you just come with some ideas, and the rest is just listening, observing and absorbing what program execution tells you about what you've done and thus what to change to accommodate your learnings.  Being great at debugging is the corallary.  It just meant you could get through the cycle much faster.  Speeding up that improvement loop, over the long term, is how to develop deep skills in a shorter amount of time.

So the first skill is accepting the mindset of having ideas, but being willing to listen to ground truth and adapting.  Fundamentally learning humility from your side of the keyboard.  The second skill is learning how to debug.

## Mathematical influence

When I first started programming I noticed my mathematical background a little lacking.  At the age of 12, I didn't know what an integer was, and had basic knowledge of binary, powers of two, hexadecimal, and was new to the concept of floating point.  But these are just some basics easily acquired through high school.

The next aspect of mathematics I came across was logic, arithmetic logic and predicate logic.  This is the meat and bones of if-then-else clauses.  This is also easily learnt.

The next was a really big step.  As you progress further in a mathematical education, things start getting abstract, and this continues for a long time.

One important tool in software engineering is data hiding, or rather "abstract data types".  Finding a deeper insight into our software so that we can craft abstractions that clearly convey the concept of what is at hand, whilst hiding uninteresting details is the core of building significant software systems.  As system get large, and are often very large, layers of abstraction are key to keeping the system coherent and maintainable.

I've found that mathematical thinking has been a key helper for me in my software career.  Being able to break something complex down into clearly separated loosely coupled components is a key skill sought for senior software positions.  My mathematical background, whilst removed from practicality, has turned out a jewel in the toolbox.  Mathematical skill is my third skill of software development.

## English influence

It is sometimes said naming things is the hardest part of software engineering.  Finding a name is hard because the right word can describe so much about intention, usage, and expectations that it is hard to get the right word.  A bad name can throw up a false mental model even before the code has been dug into, and can often steer you the wrong way even when you have read the code.

One thing, albeit later in life, I've learned to appreciate is that reading good books, in the sense of well-written books, is key to providing the right vocabulary and articulation.
They say you know the meaning of a word by the company it keeps.  That is, to really refine your understanding of a word, you have to see how it is used.  The more you read (audio books count) the more you recognise the meaning of words because you've seen how beautifully they can be all connected together to provide deeper meaning.

I find it now quite easy to give abstractions the right name.  It is usually the case that a few closely related words come to mind.  The skill is developing the taste to know which is the most appropriate word.  English language skill is my fourth skill of software development.
